## Proofs
- Proof by cases: Split proof into several cases. Each case has its own assumption.
- Proof by induction:
	- Identify the property $P(n)$
	1. **Induction Base:** Let $n=0$. Show $P(0)$ holds. (Direct proof)
	2. **Induction Step:** Let $k\in \Bbb N$.
		- Assume $P(k)$ holds (induction hypothesis)
		- Then show $P(k+1)$ holds.
