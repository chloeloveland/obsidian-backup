The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a common [[logical circuit]]. It serves to perform mathematical functions in the CPU. It is comprised of a full [[adder]], a logical unit (to perform [[boolean logic]]), and a [[decoder]]. These are combined as seen:

> The [[Decoder]] selects which function(s) are used; adder or boolean logic

These 1 bit ALUs can be combined to create a multi-bit ALU:
