## CISC
CISC (complex instruction set computing) utilises [[CPU|CPUs]] with large instruction sets. This means the CPU has more built in functionality.

## RISC
RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) utilises [[CPU|CPUs]] with smaller instruction sets. This arose as the need for low memory usage dwindled in favour of more performance.

RISC focuses on making the instructions that are used frequently very performant
