A dictionary is a collection of items, similar to lists and [[Tuples]]. However, unlike lists and tuples, each item in a dictionary is a **key-value** pair (consisting of a key and a value).

Python syntax:
```
country_capitals = {
  "Germany": "Berlin", 
  "Canada": "Ottawa", 
  "England": "London"
}
```
