Dijkstra's shortest path is an algorithm designed to find the shortest path from one node to another in a weighted [[graph]].

## The algorithm
1. Mark the source node with a current distance of 0 and the rest with infinity.
2. Set the non-visited node with the smallest current distance as the current node.
3. For each neighbor, N of the current node adds the current distance of the adjacent node with the weight of the edge connecting 0->1. If it is smaller than the current distance of Node, set it as the new current distance of N.
4. Mark the current node 1 as visited.
5. Go to step 2 if there are any nodes are unvisited.
