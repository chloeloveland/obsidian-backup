Good documentation should facilitate:
- The consistent exchange of information  
	- *So standardised templates should be used*  
- Show the clear provenance of information and data  
	-  *Authors and editors should make use of version histories*  
-  Preserve the original meaning of data and information  
	- *Restrictions on access should be used as needed*  
- Be comprehensible to the relevant stakeholders  
	- *Documents should be audited and verified for readability and consistency*


> [!Tip] Metadata
> Appropriate use of [[Metadata]] helps with all of the above.
