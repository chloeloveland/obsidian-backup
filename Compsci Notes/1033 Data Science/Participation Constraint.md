- A **participation constraint** imposes some requirements on the number of times an [[Entity]] participates in a [[Relationship]]
    - Total participation: Each [[Entity]] must participate in at least one [[Relationship]]
	    - e.g every order to an online store **must have a customer**
    - Partial participation: an [[Entity]] may not participate in a relationship
        - not all library card holders will borrow a book
        - not all books will be borrowed
        - so we can't have total participation
