- There are two levels of data independence in a [[Databases]]
- It revolves around the separation of different [[Data abstractions#^ls2nlt|abstraction levels]]
- **Logical independence** is the idea that changes to the conceptual schema should not require changes to the external schema, or rewrites of the application
- **Physical independence** is the idea that changes to the internal level (i.e. hardware changes or different filesystem) should not require any change to the conceptual or external level
