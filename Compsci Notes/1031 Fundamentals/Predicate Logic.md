Predicate logic is an extension of [[propositional logic]] which allows for reasoning over infinite sets of values.

## Predicates
A predicate is essentially a proposition with a piece of information missing. The predicate P(x) becomes a proposition - and thus is true or false - when we instantiate its variables with values.



## Universal quantifier
- Need to capture that variable x **holds a property over all of the values** of a set.
- This is done using the **universal quantifier** ($\forall$).
	- Usage: $\forall x \in A =$ "for all values in set A"
