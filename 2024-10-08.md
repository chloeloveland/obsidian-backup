## Relations
- Unary relations are a way to identify elements in a set which have an important property.
	- They return true or false
	- For example, performing primary(red) on a set of **colours** would return true.
	- But how to define primary?
		- We can say primary is a [[subset]] of colours
		- but to be less ambiguous, we would list the primary colours as a set
			- $primary= \{red, blue, yellow\}$
		- a more mathematical way of writing primary(red) is to ask if red is an [[Element|member]] of colours
			- i.e. $red $
