- A weak entity is an [[entity]] with insufficient attributes to form a [[keys|primary key]]
- they can be identified uniquely by considering the primary key of another (owner) entity
    - Example:
        - Employees can purchase insurance policies to cover dependents
        - these dependents attributes are only *pname* and *dateofbirth*
        - this is a weak entity
        - so it is identified using the primary key of **employee**
- **Restrictions**
    - Owner and weak must have a one to many [[relationship]] (where owner is one)
    - Weak entity must have [[Participation Constraint|total participation]] in the identifying relationship
