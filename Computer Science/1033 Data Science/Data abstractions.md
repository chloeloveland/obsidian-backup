## Data abstractions

- Abstraction is the concept of removing unnecessary data; the user does not need to know everything about the [[Databases|database]]
- there are three levels of data abstractions for a database

> - the **external** level is the what a user might see - their basket on their shopping site, for example
>- different users can have different permissions
>- the **conceptual** level describes what data is stored in the database as well as the relationships between this data
>- the **internal** level is the physical representation of the database on the computer; it describes how the data is stored on the database
