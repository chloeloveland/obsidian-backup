- A form of conceptual data model which models data and constraints as entities and relationships
- An **entity** is a real world object which is unique/distinguishable
- an entity is represented by a set of attributes, whose unique values are stored to distinguish
- a person's attributes may be their name/DOB/height etc.
- an entity must have at least one attribute
- otherwise it is not distinguishable and has no data that needs storing
