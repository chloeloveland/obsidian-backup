- Database design can be divided into six steps
    1. Requirements analysis - what data; for what application; what operations are most frequent
    2. Conceptual design - A high level description of the data to be saved and the contraints put on the design
    3. Logical design - decide upon a DBMS; convert the conceptual design into the database schema in the chosen DBMS
    4. Schema Refinement - analyse the collection of relations; identify potential problems; refine the schema
    5. Physical design - ensure that the design meets performance requirements; build indexes, cluster tables etc; redesign parts of the database schema
    6. Application and security design - write the application; identify data that can be accessible by certain users; take steps to ensure that access rules are correctly enforced
