- A database is a way of linking together data about different things - i.e. [[Entity]]
- They are used primarily to reduce data redundancy and to introduce better ways to search through and apply data
- A database has a data model (relational, object oriented etc) and a **[[Schema]]**
- The data that the end user sees is [[Data abstractions|abstracted]]: The users do not need to know the physical storage details
- Databases are [[Database design|designed]] through a process to ensure they meet certain requirements such as [[Data Independence]], *referential integrity*, and *data efficiency*.
	- One way to ensure a database is properly designed is using [[Normalisation]]
