- A database has a data model (relational, object oriented etc) and a **[[Schema]]** 
- The data that the end user sees is [[Data abstractions|abstracted]]: The users do not need to know the physical storage details
- Databases are [[Database design|designed]] through a process to ensure they have [[Data Independence]] 
- Declarative query language is used to specify what should be returned, but does not tell the computer how to retrieve that data.
