- A **participation constraint** imposes some requirements on the number of times an [[entity]] participates in a [[relationship]]
    - Total participation: Each entity must participate in at least one relationship
        - every order to an online store **must have a customer**
    - Partial participation: an [[entity]] may not participate in a relationship
        - not all library card holders will borrow a book
        - not all books will be borrowed
        - so we can't have total participation
