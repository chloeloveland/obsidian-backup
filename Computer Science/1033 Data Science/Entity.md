- An entity is a real world object which is unique/distinguishable
- an entity is represented by a set of attributes, whose unique values are stored to distinguish
- a person's attributes may be their name/DOB/height etc.
- an entity must have at least one attribute
- otherwise it is not distinguishable and has no data that needs storing
- in a database entities are linked together using [[Relationship]]
	- see [[Entity-Relationship diagram]]
- an entity must have a [[Key|primary key]]; if a primary key cannot be made, the entity is a [[Weak entity]]
