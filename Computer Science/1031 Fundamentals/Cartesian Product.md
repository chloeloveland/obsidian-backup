## Cartesian Product

- Notation is AxB where A and B are sets
- This product is a set which contains all possible [[Tuples]] of (element from A, element from B)

> [!Example]
> - Let $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {a, b}$.
> - $A\times B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)}$**
- Since order is considered in Tuples, AxB is **not** the same as BxA.
- To find the cardinality of the product of two sets, we just multiply the cardinalities of the individual sets together. e.g $|A| = 2$ and $|B| = 3$, then $|A\times B| = 6$> 
- To find the [[Cardinality]] of the power set, we do 2^(cardinality of set). For example, $|A| = 10$, then $|P(A)| = 2^{10}$.
