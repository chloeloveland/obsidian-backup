## Cartesian Product
- Notation is $A\times B$ where $A$ and $B$ are sets
- This product is a set which contains all possible [[Tuples]] of (element from A, element from B)
> [!Example]
> - Let $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {a, b}$.
> - $A\times B = {(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)}$
- Since order is considered in [[Tuples]], AxB is **not** the same as BxA.
- To find the cardinality of the product of two sets, we just multiply the cardinalities of the individual sets together. e.g $|A| = 2$ and $|B| = 3$, then $|A\times B| = 6$>
