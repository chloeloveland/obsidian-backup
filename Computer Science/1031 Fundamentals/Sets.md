## What is a set?

- A set is a collection of [[Element|elements]]
- Can contain infinite elements
- Elements in the set are unordered - more like a bag than a list
- There are no duplicates in a set
- Sets are typically [[Set Notation|denoted]] by a capital letter (A, B, X, Y etc.)
- There are some [[Common Sets]] used in mathematics
## Operating on sets

- Sets can be operated on in various ways
- For example, we can combine them using *intersection* or *union*
- For the various operators and their symbols, see [[Set Notation]]
- Set operations can be represented and simplified using [[Venn diagrams]]

> [!Help] Why is this useful?
> - Sets and [[tuples]] can be used to abstractly model systems
> - Tuples for objects and sets for collections of objects
> - So we could have tuples which represent drinks and their prices
> - and a set which contains all of these different drinks options
