## What is a set?

- A set is a collection of [[Element|elements]]
- Can contain infinite elements
- Elements in the set are unordered - more like a bag than a list
- There are no duplicates in a set
- Sets are typically [[Set Notation|denoted]] by a capital letter (A, B, X, Y etc.)

## Common Sets

- ℕ is the natural numbers set (1, 2, 3, ...)
- ℤ is the integers set (-1, 0, 1, ...)
- ℚ is the rational numbers (nums that can be expressed as a fraction)
- ℝ is the real numbers (a number on the number line, any 1 dimensional value)
## Operating on sets

- Sets can be operated on in various ways
- For example, we can combine them using *intersection* or *union*
- For the various operators and their symbols, see [[Set Notation]]

> [!Why is this useful?]
> - Sets and [[tuples]] can be used to abstractly model systems
> - Tuples for objects and sets for collections of objects
> - So we could have tuples which represent drinks and their prices
> - and a set which contains all of these different drinks options
