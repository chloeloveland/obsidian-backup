- A power set is the set of all possible [[subset|subsets]] that can be generated from one [[Sets|set]]
- Since it is a set of subsets, each [[element]] is a set, rather than a value. on its own.
- it is denoted by a fancy P: $\mathcal P (A)$ is power set of A
- To find the [[cardinality]] of the power set, we do $2^{n}$ where . For example, $|A| = 10$, then $|P(A)| = 2^{10}$.
