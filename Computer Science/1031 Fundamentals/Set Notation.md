## Set Notation

- Can be notated as {1,2,3,4} or {1,2,...,100}
    - See [[Expressing Sets]]
    
- ∈ denotes membership e.g $2 ∈ ℕ$
    - This means the element 2 is in the set ℕ

- ∉ denotes lack of membership e.g -1 ∉ ℕ

- ⊂ denotes [[Subset]] e.g ℕ⊂ℤ, {1,2} ⊂ {1,2,3} ^pa0ckp
    - This means the whole set ℕ is in ℤ

- ⊆ denotes subset or equal (so the sets can actually be identical) whereas ⊂ is a 'proper' subset

- ⊄ means not a (proper) subset

- $\mathcal P$ is a [[Power Set]]. A power set is a set which contains all possible subsets of its defining set.

- AxB denotes the cartesian product of sets A and B
- A line before and after a set - e.g |AxB| - is the cardinality (size) of the set
- $\cup$ denotes union
    - union is the combination of sets; ${A \cup B}$ is all the elements of both A and B
- $\cap$  denotes intersection 
    - intersection returns the elements two sets have in common
- $\backslash$ denotes difference
    - difference finds the set of elements that are not common
    - ${A\backslash B}$ essentially returns A take away B
    - so if A = {1,2,3} and B= {1,2}, then ${A\backslash B}$ = {3}
    - note that set difference is **non-commutative**
    - So ${A\backslash B \neq B \backslash A}$
