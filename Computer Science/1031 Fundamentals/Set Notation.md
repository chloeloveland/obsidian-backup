- Can be notated as {1,2,3,4} or {1,2,...,100}
    - See [[Expressing Sets]] for more ways    
- ∈ denotes [[element|membership]]
- ∉ denotes lack of [[element|membership]] e.g -1 ∉ ℕ
- ⊂ denotes [[subset]] e.g ℕ⊂ℤ, {1,2} ⊂ {1,2,3} ^pa0ckp
    - This means the whole set ℕ is in ℤ
- $A\$ means not a subset
- $\mathcal P$(A) denotes a [[Power Set]] (of A).
- $A\times B$ denotes the [[cartesian product]] of sets A and B
- A line (pipe) before and after a set - e.g $|A|$ or $|A\times B|$ - is the [[cardinality]] of the set ^o5fo19
- $A\cup B$ denotes union
    - union is the combination of sets; ${A \cup B}$ is all the elements of both A and B
- $A\cap B$  denotes intersection 
    - intersection returns the elements two sets have in common
- $A\backslash B$ denotes [[Set Difference]]
