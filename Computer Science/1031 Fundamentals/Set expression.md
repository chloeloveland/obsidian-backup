## Set Comprehension

- One way to show the members of a set is to list them
- this does not work for large sets
- for this we may use set comprehension:
- e.g {x I xâˆˆ{1, ..., 100}, x<10 and x is odd}
- this is defining a set using another set
- so the result is a set which contains the odd numbers 1-10
- the format for this notation is as seen:
- so the result set is 42 , 22 = 16, 4
