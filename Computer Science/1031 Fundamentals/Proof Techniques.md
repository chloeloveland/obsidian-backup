In some important systems (car AI, autopilot, nuclear reactor etc.) it is critical that software never fails. In these situations, mere testing is not enough:

> "Testing can show presence of errors but not their absence" - Dijkstra

So instead we use mathematical reasoning (proof) to rigorously show that a property holds.

## Theorem
A theorem assumes some facts (assumptions) hold and then based on these infers a new cast
