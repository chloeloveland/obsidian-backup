- [[Set operations can be represented and thus simplified using Venn diagrams.
- The operation $A\cap B$ can be seen below as a diagram: ![[Venn Diagram 1]]
- The shaded area is that which is represented by the operation
- This can be used to simplify complex operations
- We draw the diagram, then work backwards to see if there is a simpler way to textually express it
