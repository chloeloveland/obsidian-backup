- A function maps input values to output values
- it is a mapping between two [[sets]]
	- The *Domain Set* (input)
	- and the *Codomain Set* (output)

> [!info] **Key properties of a function**
> - A function must map every input to an output
> 	- This is **totality**
> - it must always produce the same output for a given input
> 	- This is **unambiguity**
> 	- (Note: the same output **is** allowed to be mapped to multiple inputs)

> They **must** be true for a *true* function
### Defining a function
> [!example]
> - $h =\Bbb N\rightarrow\Bbb R$
>- $h(x) =$ $x\over 2$
>
>This will return half of x for any x
### Mapping a function
- A function's domain and codomain can be mapped to one another using one of a few methods
	- **Listing**: For small functions we can map every input to every output

### Function composition
- Multiple functions can be composited together to make a new function
- $f\circ g = f(g(x)))$

> [!Attention] Important
> - Two functions f and g can only be composed if the codomain of f = domain of g
