- A function maps input values to output values
- Every function is a [[relations|relation]]
- it is a mapping between two [[sets]]
	- The *Domain Set* (input)
	- and the *Codomain Set* (output)

### Defining a function
> [!example]
> - $h =\Bbb N\rightarrow\Bbb R$
>- $h(x) =$ $x\over 2$

>This will return half of x for any x

A function can also be defined [[Recursive Function|recursively]]
### Mapping a function
- A function's domain and codomain can be mapped to one another using one of a few methods
	- **Listing**: For small functions we can map every input to every output

### Function composition
- Multiple functions can be composited together to make a new function
- $f\circ g = f(g(x)))$

> [!Attention] Important
> - Two functions $f$ and $g$ can only be composed if the codomain of $f =$ domain of $g$
> - if this is not true you simply cannot do it

- Function composition is very useful for data analytics because it allows you to split a complex function into simpler functions that can then be composed together

### Function properties
- Some functions satisfy certain important [[Properties of functionsproperties]]
