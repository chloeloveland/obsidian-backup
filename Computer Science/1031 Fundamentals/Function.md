- A function maps input values to output values
- It is a specific type of [[relations|relation]]
- it is a mapping between two [[sets]]
	- The *Domain Set* (input)
	- and the *Codomain Set* (output)

## Defining a function

> - $h =\Bbb N\rightarrow\Bbb R$
>- $h(x) =$ $x\over 2$

>This will return half of x for any x
## Mapping a function
- A function's domain and codomain can be mapped to one another using one of a few methods
	- **Listing**: For small functions we can map every input to every output
	- **Composition**: see [[Function Composition]]
	- **Recursion**: see [[Recursive Function]]

## Inverse function
- Some functions can be undone; some cannot
- if function is $f$, inverse denoted as $f^{-1}$
- A function only has an inverse if it is [[Properties of functions#Bijective|bijective]]

> [!Example]
> - Let $f:\{a,b,c\} \rightarrow \{2,4,6\}$
> - $f(a) = 2$, $f^{-1}(2) = a$
> 
> this is an example of a function ***with*** an inverse

## Function properties
- Some functions satisfy certain important [[Properties of functions|properties]]
