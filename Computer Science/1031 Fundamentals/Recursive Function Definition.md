- A recursive function is a [[function]] defined using recursion
- This is similar to [[Expressing Sets#Recursion|recursive set definition]]
- You have a base case and a recursive case
- the base case is a single relation e.g. $f(0) = 0$
- the recursive case then defines the rest based on this e.g. for any $x \in \Bbb N$, define $f(x) = f(x-1) + x$
