- Some [[function|functions]] satisfy certain importantÂ properties.

## Surjective
- True if every value in the codomain is used.
	- i.e. cod f = rng f (the codomain is the same size as the range)

## Injective
- True if every input gives a unique output
	- i.e. |dom f| = |rng f|

## Bijective
- True if both surjective and injective

## Reasoning using properties
- If we know a a function is *surjective* and/or *injective*, we can use this to reason about a function
	- Example: if a function is bijective then it has an [[inverse function]]
