Some [[function|functions]] satisfy certain importantÂ properties.

## Surjective
- True if every value in the codomain is used.
	- i.e. cod f = rng f (the codomain is the same size as the range)

## Injective
- True if every input gives a unique output

## Bijective
- True if both surjective and injective
