1. {i} A is a set, B is a set, and $|A|>|B|$ are assumptions. Conclusion is $A\backslash B \neq \{\}$.
2. No, yes, no, yes. No because in those examples $|A|>|B|$ is <mark class="hltr-red">not true</mark>.

1. {i} A, B and C are sets, $A\subseteq B$ and $B\backslash C = \{\}$ are all assumptions. $A\subseteq C$ is a conclusion.
2. ...
	1. $A\subseteq B$ is true, $B\backslash C = \{\}$ is true. So <mark class="hltr-green">yes</mark>. 
	2. $A\subseteq B$ is false,
