Assume A and B are sets. Assume $A\cap B = A$. Conclude $A\subseteq B$.
**Theorem:**
Let A and B be sets such that $A\cap B = A$. Then we have $A\subseteq B$.

1. By assumption we know A must contain more elements than B.
2. By 1) we know that A must contain some values not in B.
3. By definition we know A\B is A with B removed.
4. By def of set and definition of set difference we know $A\backslash B \neq \{\}$.

1. {i}
	1. By assumption we know that $A\cup B = B$.
	2. By 1) and definition of union, we know that all elements in A are in B.
	3. By 2) and definition of set difference, $A\backslash B = \{\}$.

2. ...
	1. By def of subtraction we know that 6-2 = 4
	2. by def of multiplication we know that 4x2x2 = 16
	3. by definition of power we know that $2^4 = 16$
	4. It follows from 2) and 3) that $(6-2)\times2\times2 = 2^4$

3. Assume $A\subseteq B$. Prove $A\cap B = A$.
	1. By assumption $A\subseteq B$ and definition of subset we know that all elements in A are in B.
	2. By definition of intersection we know that $A\cap B$ is the set containing all common members of A and B.
	3. It follows from 1) and 2) that $A\cap B = A$.
