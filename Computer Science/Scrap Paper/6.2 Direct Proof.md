Assume A and B are sets. Assume $A\cap B = A$. Conclude $A\subseteq B$.
**Theorem:**
Let A and B be sets such that $A\cap B = A$. Then we have $A\subseteq B$.

1. By assumption we know A must contain more elements than B.
2. By 1) we know that A must contain some values not in B.
3. By definition we know A\B is A with B removed.
4. By def of set and definition of set difference we know $A\backslash B \neq \{\}$.

	1. By assumption we know that $A\cup B = B$.
	2. By 1) and definition of union, we know that all elements in A are in B.
	3. By 2) and definition of set difference, $A\backslash B = \{\}$.
