Assume A and B are sets. Assume $A\cap B = A$. Conclude $A\subseteq B$. <mark class="hltr-green">Correct</mark>
**Theorem:**
Let A and B be sets such that $A\cap B = A$. Then we have $A\subseteq B$. <mark class="hltr-green">Correct</mark>

1. By assumption we know A must contain more elements than B.
2. By 1) we know that A must contain some values not in B.
3. We know A\B is A with B removed.
4. By def of set and definition of set difference we know $A\backslash B \neq \{\}$.
