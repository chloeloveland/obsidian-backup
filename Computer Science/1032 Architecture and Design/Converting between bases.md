- We can convert between [[bases]] using specific procedures.
- Conversion to decimal from other bases involves adding up the numeric values ($2^n$ where n is the position from right to left)
- Decimal to binary has a specific procedure:
	- 
- Binary to hexadecimal is easy; we split the binary into nibbles (groups of 4) the values of these will be the digits of the hexadecimal.
- We can convert to octal the same way; just group into 3 instead of 4.
