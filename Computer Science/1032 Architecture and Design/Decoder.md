- A decoder does the opposite job of an encoder. It is a combinational circuit that converts n lines of input into 2


n

lines of output. Letâ€™s take an example of 3-to-8 line decoder.

| A   | B   | C   | F7-F0 |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |       |
| 0   | 0   | 1   |       |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |       |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |       |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |       |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |       |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |       |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |       |
