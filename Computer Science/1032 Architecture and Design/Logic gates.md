- A logic gate is an electrical component which takes inputs and gives an output. Examples include AND, NOT, OR, XOR, etc.
- there are various symbols represent these - you already know them :P
- The combination of several logic gates to make specific functions is a [[logical circuit]]
- Logic gate I/O can be represented using [[Truth tables]]
- Logic gates are made up of [[Transistors]], which is what allows them to physically work
