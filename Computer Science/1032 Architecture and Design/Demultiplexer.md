- The demultiplexer is a [[logical circuit]] which performs the inverse function of the [[multiplexer]].
- It distributes multiple outputs from a single input; thus it can also be known as a **data distributor**, or **demux** in shorthand.
- It operates by using a control signal which selects which output line receives the data.
	- If we have 4 data channels, we need 2 selector lines (00,01,10,11) :)
