- An encoder is a [[logical circuit]] which takes multiple inputs and produces a **coded output**.
- This is in contrast to a [[multiplexer]] which takes multiple inputs and just forwards data to one.
- The encoder takes $2^n$ inputs and encodes to $n$ outputs.
- This encoded data can then be decoded using a [[decoder]]
