## Truth tables

- The I/O of Logic Gates and circuits can be represented by truth tables
## Internals of gates
- Logic gates in computer systems are comprised of p-MOS and n-MOS [[transistors]]
- these are combined in different ways to make logic gates physically work
## Boolean algebra

- Boolean logic circuits can be represented using boolean algebra
- AND is represented by a dot or proximity e.g A•B or AB
- OR is represented by a plus i.e. A+B
- NOT is represented by a bar above e.g A̅B̅
- There are a few laws of equivalence that determine which boolean logic circuits are equivalent to one another
- Their names are not really important but we are expected to be able to use them to simplify boolean expressions.
