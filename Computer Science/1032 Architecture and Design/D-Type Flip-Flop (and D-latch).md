- A D type flip-flop uses the [[SR latch]], a [[clock]] and a **D** input:

> - The D Flip-Flop latches into the SR latch the value of D when the clock rising or falling
> 	- It may latch when the clock is rising or falling depending on the type of D flip flop

- The D flip flop can have its own [[Symbols for latches and flip flops|symbol]]
- The **D latch** is slightly different to the **flip-flop**
	- Instead of latching on an edge, a *d-latch* latches on a certain clock *level* (high or low)
