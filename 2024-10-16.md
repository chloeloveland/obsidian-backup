Hi, I was wondering when you would email!! I'd be more than happy to help you out :D I'll try my best to format this as there's quite a bit of information - also this is all off memory so I may forget some stuff.
### Hormones
There's two main things you would want to take for mtf hrt, which is oestradiol (aka estrogen) and a testosterone blocker. T blockers vary a lot in price and side effects and things. The common options are:
- GnRH agonist (aka puberty blockers)
	- this is the best one as there is pretty much no side effects
	- it is also expensive
- Spironolactone
	- This is cheap
	- It is a diuretic - makes you pee and sweat a lot more
	- It also lowers your blood pressure (not )
	- I didn't really like it
