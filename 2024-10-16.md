Hi, I was wondering when you would email!! I'd be more than happy to help you out :D I'll try my best to format this as there's quite a bit of information - I'm aware you're not sure where to start so I'm going to try to give you as broad of an information base as I can.
## Navigating GenderCare
Honestly, I am not an expert on this part as I am with GenderGP. I can tell you that GenderGP are terrible and that gendercare is far better.
For help understanding how to start with gendercare, look [here](https://gendercare.co.uk/how-to-use-gendercare.shtml).
As far as I understand it they are the gold standard of trans healthcare :)
### Hormones
There's two main things you would usually to take for mtf hrt, which is oestradiol (aka oestrogen) and a testosterone blocker. Testosterone blockers vary a lot in price and side effects. The common options are:

- GnRH agonist (aka puberty blockers)
	- this is the best one - there is pretty much no side effects
	- but it is also expensive
- Spironolactone
- Cyproterone

Since you're on gendercare it's very likely you will be prescribed GnRH (the good one) which is fantastic. You very likely will not need to cover the prescription cost because of a thing called shared care, which I will go over now.

### Shared care (and blood tests)
Some NHS GPs offer a service called shared care. This is where the GP will take the advice of a private healthcare service (like gendercare) and will provide NHS prescriptions and blood tests on their behalf.
GPs are very likely to agree to this with gendercare because they are based in the UK. (GenderGP on the other hand, they really will never do it for).

**To get this sorted with a GP,** you should speak to your provider at gendercare to ask if they will provide you with a *letter for shared care agreement* (or something along those lines). Once they provide this to you, **book a GP appointment** and ask to discuss shared care. They will ask which private provider you are with. Since you are with gendercare, they will then usually ask for the shared care letter you got from them. Once this is all sorted out and agreed to, gendercare will request your blood tests and prescriptions **for you.**
