A graph is a mathematical structure for representing relationships. They are used to model many real-world scenarios.

## Mathematical definition
- A graph is an ordered pair $G=(V,E)$ where:
	- $V$ is a set of vertices
	- $E$ is a set of edges $E\subset V\times V$ (see [[Cartesian Product]])
- $E$ is either a set of **ordered** or **unordered** pairs:
	- If **ordered**, is a *directed graph*
	- If **unordered**, is an *undirected graph*
- Each edge is a pair of **start** and **end** nodes (a.k.a. **source** and **sink**)
