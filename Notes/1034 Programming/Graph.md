A graph is a mathematical structure for representing relationships. They are used to model many real-world scenarios.

## Mathematical definition
- A graph is an [[tuples#Ordered pair|ordered pair]] $G=(V,E)$ where:
	- $V$ is a set of vertices
	- $E$ is a set of edges $E\subset V\times V$ (see [[Cartesian Product]])
- $E$ is a set of either **ordered** or **unordered** pairs:
	- If **ordered**, graph is a *directed graph*
	- If **unordered**, graph is an *undirected graph*
- Each edge is a pair of **start** and **end** nodes (a.k.a. **source** and **sink**)

## Types of graph
- Labelled graph
	- Nodes, edges can have labels (city names, road names etc.)
- Weighted graph
	- Edges can have a numerical values
	-
