- Metadata is *data about data*
- It has several purposes:
	- To <mark class="hltr-pink">describe data</mark>
	- To provide <mark class="hltr-pink">information on the structure of data</mark>
	- To help <mark class="hltr-pink">manage data</mark>
		- Access levels etc.
- [[Entity|Entities]] and [[Databases]] can have metadata, which can help make the data more useful
	- [[SQL|MySQL]] has a lot of inbuilt metadata

## Creating Metadata
- Metadata can be created manually by a user or automatically by a system
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Context</mark> and <mark class="hltr-yellow">provenance</mark> are key
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Context</mark> is the information that adds usefulness to the data
	- includes date of last edit
	- number of edits 
	- etc.
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Provenance</mark> is information about the processes that have been applied to the data
	- who has made changes
	- what maths has been applied 
	- etc.

## Adding metadata
- there is no standard way to add metadata
- metadata formats include:
	- Exif for images
		- Contains image size, camera model, location etc.
