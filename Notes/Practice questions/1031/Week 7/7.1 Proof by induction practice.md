1. {i} **Base**
	1. By definition of addition know 0+0 = 0
	2. By definition of multiplication know 2x0 = 0
	3. From 1) and 2) it follows that 0+0 = 2x0
2. **Induction step**: show (k+1) + (k+1) = 2(k+1)
	1. By def of addition know $(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+k) + (1+1)$
	2. By induction hypothesis
	3. by def of + 
	4. by def of + and *

1. {i} Property is $3\times (n+2) = (3\times n) + 6$
2. **Base:** Let n=0. Show $3\times (0+2) = (3*0) + 6$ holds.
	1. By definition of multiplication and addition know $3\times (0+2) = 6$
	2. By definition of multiplication and addition know $(3*0) + 6 = 6$
	3. From 1) and 2) know $3\times (0+2) = (3*0) + 6$
3. **Induction Step:** Let $k\in \Bbb N$
	1. Assume $3\times (k+2) = (3\times k) + 6$ holds. (Induction hypothesis)
	2. Show $3\times (k+1+2) = (3\times k+1) + 6$ holds.
	3. By definition of addition and multiplication (distribution) know that $3\times(k+1+2) = 3k+9$
	4. By definition of addition and multiplication (distribution) know that $(3\times k) +1$
