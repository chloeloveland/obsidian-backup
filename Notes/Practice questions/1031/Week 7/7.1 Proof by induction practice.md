1. {i} **Base**
	1. By definition of addition know 0+0 = 0
	2. By definition of multiplication know 2x0 = 0
	3. From 1) and 2) it follows that 0+0 = 2x0
2. **Induction step**: show (k+1) + (k+1) = 2(k+1)
	1. By def of addition know $(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+k) + (1+1)$
	2. By induction hypothesis
	3. by def of + 
	4. by def of + and *
