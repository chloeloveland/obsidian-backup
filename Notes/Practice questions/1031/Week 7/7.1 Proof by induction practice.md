1. {i} 
	1. By definition of addition know 0+0 = 0
	2. By definition of multiplication know 2x0 = 0
	3. From 1) and 2) it follows that 0+0 = 2x0
2. show (k+1) + (k+1) = 2(k+1)
	1. By induction hypothesis know $k+k = 2\times k$
	2. By def of addition know $(k+1) + (k+1) = (k+k) + (1+1)$
	3. By induction hypothesis
	4.
