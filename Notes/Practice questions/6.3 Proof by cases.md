**Case 1: x = y**
1. By assumption x=y and definition of if, we know m=y.
2. By assumption x=y, and 1), it follows m=x.

**Case 2: x $\neq$ y**
1. By assumption x $\neq$ y and definition of if, know that m=x.

PROVE FOR ANY NATURAL NUMBERS x, y, max(x, y) >= x

**Case 1:** $x\ge y$
1. By definition of max and assumption x>=y, know that $max(x, y) = x$.
2. By definition of $\ge$, $x\ge x$
3. It follows from 1) and 2) that $max(x, y) \ge x$

**Case 2:** $x<y$
1. By definition of max and assumption x<y, know that max(x, y) = y.
2. By definition of $\ge$, $x\ge x$
