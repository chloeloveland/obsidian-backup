- Boolean logic can be represented using boolean algebra
- AND is represented by a dot or proximity e.g $A\bullet B$ or $AB$
- OR is represented by a plus i.e. $A+B$
- NOT is represented by a bar above e.g $\overline{AB}$
- There are a few laws of equivalence that determine which boolean logic circuits are equivalent to one another
- Their names are not really important but we are expected to be able to use them to simplify boolean expressions.
- In a computer system, boolean logic is performed by [[Logic gates]].
