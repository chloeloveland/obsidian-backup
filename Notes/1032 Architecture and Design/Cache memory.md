Cache memory is a high-speed, low-capacity [[memory]] which is used within the [[CPU]]. It allows for the CPU to operate faster by placing commonly accessed data close to the rest of the CPU.

> [!Info] Principle of locality
> If a particular storage location is referenced, it is likely that nearby memory location will be referenced soon

## Direct mapped cache
- The simplest cache is <mark class="hltr-orange">**direct-mapped**</mark>
- If a byte is present in cache, it can only be in **one place**
