The arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a common [[Logical circuit]]. It serves to perform mathematical functions in the CPU. It is comprised of a full [[Adder]], a logical unit (to perform [[Boolean logic]]), and a [[Decoder]]. These are combined as seen:

> The [[Decoder]] selects which function(s) are used; adder or boolean logic

These 1 bit ALUs can be combined to create a multi-bit ALU:
