- Multiple [[Function|functions]] can be composited together to make a new function
- $f\circ g = f(g(x)))$

> [!Attention] Important
> - Two functions $f$ and $g$ can only be composed if the codomain of $f =$ domain of $g$
> - if this is not true you simply cannot do it

- Function composition is very useful for data analytics because it allows you to split a complex function into simpler functions that can then be composed together
