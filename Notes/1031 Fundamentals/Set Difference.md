-  difference finds the set of elements that are not common
- ${A\backslash B}$ essentially returns A take away B
- so if A = {1,2,3} and B= {1,2}, then ${A\backslash B}$ = {3}
- note that set difference is **non-commutative**
- So ${A\backslash B \neq B \backslash A}$
- Expressed as a [[Venn diagrams|Venn diagram]], we get this:
