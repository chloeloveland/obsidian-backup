- A tuple is an ordered list of values, where each is from its own set
- if set $A = {tea, coffee}$ and set $B = \Bbb R$, then a tuple from these sets could be $(tea, 1.2)$ or $(coffee, 2)$ etc.
- **in a tuple order is considered, unlike a set**
- For generation of tuples, see [[Cartesian Product]]

## Ordered pair
A 2-tuple (a tuple of two values) is also referred to as an ordered pair.
