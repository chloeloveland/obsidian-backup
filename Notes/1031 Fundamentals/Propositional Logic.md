Propositional logic is a simple logic used for reasoning about expressions that are either **true** or **false**. This is important in computing where many things exist in a binary state.

## Syntax
- Propositional variables are represented by letters
	- Typically $p, q, r...$

| Informal | Mathematical | Circuits      |
| :------- | :----------- | ------------- |
| True     | T            | 0             |
| False    | F            | 1             |
| not p    | $Â¬p$         | $\bar p$      |
| p or q   | $p\lor q$    | $p+q$         |
| p and q  | $p \land q$  | $p \bullet q$ |

## Semantics
- Each **proposition** has the value T or F
- not is a.k.a. negation
- or is a.k.a. disjunction
- and is a.k.a. conjunction

## Truth tables
We can use truth tables to check all the possible behaviours of a propositional formula.
