Propositional logic is a simple logic used for reasoning about expressions that are either **true** or **false**. This is important in computing where many things exist in a binary state.

## Syntax
- Propositional variables are represented by letters
	- Typically $p, q, r...$
- Define propositional logic over **true** or **false**

| Informal | Mathematical |
| -------- | ------------ |
| True     | T            |
| False    | F            |
| not p    | Â¬p           |
| p or q   | $p\lor q$    |
| p and q  | $p \land q$  |
