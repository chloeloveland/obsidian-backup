## Data Independence

- there are two levels of data independence
- **Logical independence** is the idea that changes to the conceptual schema should not require changes to the external schema, or rewrites of the application
- **Physical independence**  is the idea that changes to the internal schema (i.e hardware changes or different filesystem) should not require any change to the conceptual or external schemas
